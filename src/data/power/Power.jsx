This dynamic increases the amount of energy that is regularly lost in transmission and distribution across distances powerlines - estimated to be between 10-20%.¬πùÑí¬≤'},
    {type: 'p', content: 'Natural gas is our second biggest source and comes with a host of expensive and risky extraction practices.  Research is warning that gas stoves and fireplaces are not good for indoor air quality so it is probably safe to assume that it is not enhancing outdoor air quality either. 90% of the costs associated with the liquified natural gas value chain occur up front so, as a province, we then commit to long term contracts in shipping it all over the world to make good on the initial investment risk.¬≥ It can seem like choices about power are outside the locus of our control but our population on Vancouver Island means that we are one of the largest customers of energy generated in BC so our consumption behaviours influence on how the whole system operates.'},

Better computer models of how our buildings are performing are needed to give robust design solutions and evidence-based policies. Data-driven methods that use machine-learning have great potential as our buildings provide lots of data, but little is currently used for reducing emissions. The ReBuild Initiative is an industry-government-academia consortium that will undertake 16 projects that encompass the breadth and complexity of the challenge, each co-designed with a partner organization to apply specific areas of research to meet their needs.'
