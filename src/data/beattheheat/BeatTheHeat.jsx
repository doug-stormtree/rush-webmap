The red polygons show areas with significant increases in average summer surface temperature from 2018 to 2021 within the CRD. Notice the relationship between heat island areas, green space and dark or paved surfaces. Urban centres with dark pavement can absorb the heat and re-emit it at a rate of 95%. Breezes and closeness to water also affect temperature."},
