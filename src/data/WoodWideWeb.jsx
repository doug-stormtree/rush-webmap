The presence of excess soil moisture at the time of any field operation is the main factor leading to soil compaction. Once a soil is compacted, the bulk density and the strength of the soil are increased. For construction purposes, a compacted soil is ideal but under normal crop production, a compacted soil can be a serious problem. Penetration into the soil by tillage implements and crop roots is restricted. The movement of air and water through the soil is hampered causing the soil to remain wet and cool long into the growing season"',

Demonstration sites of urban C sinks in public parks must be safe, visible and scientifically sound for reliable and cost-effective verification of carbon sequestration. We find that different interests can be arbitrated and that synergy that emerges from co-creation of urban C sink parks between stakeholders (scientists, city officials, companies, and citizens) can result in demo areas with maximized potential for impact, dissemination and consideration of principles of scientific experimentation."',

Approximately 75% of the Earth‚Äôs ice-free land was affected by human use by 2015.¬π Croplands cleared and used for human agriculture cover between 12-14% of the global ice-free surface.¬π Reducing the actual human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to pre-industrial levels, or even to meet targets for "well below" 2¬∞C of warming, would be impossible considering dietary needs alone.¬πùÑí¬≤ Therefore achieving "net zero" GHG emissions will require mitigation plans that include large land-based sequestration, the absorption and storage of GHGs in forests, wetlands, and soils. Land cover types have different potential for storing carbon, measured in "tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent" (tC02e) per hectare (ha), and speeds at which they accumulate that carbon, reported in tC02e/ha/year. Ecosystem connectivity is important to consider as well, as greater biodiversity can improve these potentials.'},
