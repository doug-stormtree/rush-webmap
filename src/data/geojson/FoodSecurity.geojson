But we see our neighbors’ daily struggles and feel called to do something in a way that reflects our shared values—compassion, generosity, and trust.Jessica McClard launched the grassroots mini pantry movement in May 2016 in Fayetteville, AR, when she planted the Little Free Pantry Pilot, a wooden box on a post containing food, personal care, and paper items accessible to everyone all the time, no questions asked. She hoped her spin on the Little Free Library®concept would pique local awareness of food insecurity while creating a space for neighbors to help meet neighborhood food needs. A little over a month later, CrystalRock Cathedral Women’s Ministries planted Blessing Box in Ardmore, OK. By August 2016, the movement was global. Throughout the US and internationally, the grassroots mini pantry movement continues growing and moving. ",

        "description": "In January of 2016 several downtown neighbourhood residents approached the Victoria Downtown Residents Association (DRA) via their Urban Livability Committee with the idea of establishing a downtown community garden for the Harris Green and Downtown neighbourhoods. Community Gardens have been flourishing in Victoria neighbourhoods for many years and at one time a productive community growing space existed on View Street, adjacent to the St. Vincent de Paul facility before the land was developed.In recent years the Harris Green and Downtown neighbourhoods have undergone tremendous change and that development continues today. With this in mind, local residents began the process of organizing and advocating for a community growing space for residents living in and close to the urban core.The DRA accepted the challenge and took on the garden committee and their project, providing the non-profit status designation required for funding and grant eligibility. The newly formed garden committee members began attending meetings of the Urban Food Table and became involved in a public consultation process designed to promote the city of Victoria’s “Growing in the City” initiative.In the meantime, the search was on for a suitable, available piece of property. Since most downtown property is privately owned, this proved challenging.Web Sİte:https:\/\/yatescommunitygarden.ca\/",

The intention from the start was to provide excellence in childcare and summer camps while providing young staff with great employment opportunities in a positive environment. Kids Klub now (2021) offers multiple School Age Care Sites, Summer and Spring Break Day Camps, and Childcare Services.Kids Klub’s Brown Bag Lunch Program is a service that provides lunches to any elementary and middle school in the Saanich, Victoria, and Sooke school districts who have identified children coming to school without lunches. This free service delivers over 3200 nutritious lunches to students each month. Hunger can limit a child’s ability to succeed. Our goal is that these lunches help children in our community focus, achieve more, and energize their time at school.",

For the last century and a half, Meegan has been considered part of Beacon Hill Park, owned and managed by the City of Victoria. Settler colonial practices and urbanization have endangered the Garry oak meadows on Vancouver island, BC - Meegan is one of the last remaining patches of this ecosystem. Use and management of the site as a recreational greenspace has created its own tensions and ecological impacts. This case study examines how the history of settler colonialism has created novel ecological dynamics on this site, and considers how different groups are approaching the management of these novel dynamic in different ways as informed by their differing understandings of space’s significance and history.
