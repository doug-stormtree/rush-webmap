Maps have a long history of erasure of Indigenous cultures and territories. Our goal is to promote tools that support the healing of ecosystems and communities as a way to practice reconciliation, gratitude, and respect.'},

  {type: 'p', content: 'We want to change the critical questions that get asked in planning meetings.  How is a development proposal an opportunity to increase resilience to climate-related events? How can we support neighbourhoods to adapt and thrive in changing conditions? If we extend and connect the ecosystem features across the urban landscape, what are all the benefits people would feel? How can we work with Nature to create a quality of life for all?'},
