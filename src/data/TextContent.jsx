export const TerritoryAcknowledgement = "The RUSH (Resilient Urban Systems and Habitats) Initiative is exploring this work on the unceded and unsurrendered territories of the lək̓ʷəŋən and SENĆOŦEN speaking peoples. Maps have a long history of erasure of Indigenous cultures.  Our goal is to promote tools that support the healing of ecosystems and communities as a way to practice reconciliation."

export const RushMissionStatement = "The RUSH Initiative seeks to foster ecological healing through community engagement by centralizing information on an interactive landing page that reports regional climate change vulnerabilities. As a result, the community can develop consensus on the risks and corresponding preventative actions that are needed. This tool is necessary because communities often feel disconnected from the data that motivates policymaking. Further, by leveraging geographic information systems (GIS), the data can be made comprehensible and accessible to all community members. In the long term, the RUSH platform can become a tool for the region to develop community autonomy, awareness, and agency."
