The design of these solutions are based on our planet’s natural systems, working with, and for, nature. They increase climate-resilient natural capital (such as wetlands and forests) and provide ecosystem services (such as water filtration). Communities can use nature-based solutions to support the resiliency of our climate, environment, and human society. Engage with Nature-Based Solutions is a new initiative to support communities who apply nature-based solutions to their local lands and waters. We acknowledge and take inspiration from Indigenous peoples, whose cultures and traditions support healthy ecosystems and the interconnection and importance of all living things."',

NAI teams up with local governments to develop resilient, long-term infrastructure alternatives at substantial savings. NAI employs practical strategies to value nature’s ability to provide municipal services and to incorporate this information into mainstream asset management systems. With increasing ease in measuring and valuing natural assets the NAI approach is straightforward and transferable."',

While this principle can help substantially in advancing tree equity, we need to go further. In this report, Nature Canada proposes that equitable access should be thought of in terms of three variables—proximity to urban trees and forests, urban forest quality and the governance of urban forests."',

This story map is simultaneously a place of awareness and a call to action regarding houselessness and the importance of site-supportive transitional housing. The authors aim to have this map be a center point for resources, information, and stories. While their story is situated in Victoria, British Columbia, they hope the success of the Making Room: A Transitional Tiny Home Community will inspire other similar projects and help break the cycle of houselessness."',
