A local food network means a healthier economy, more nutritious food, and a reduction in the greenhouse gasses associated with food import.",

          "CLIMAVORE, a term coined in 2015, is a call to shift to a climate-responsive food system that can grow food while cultivating habitats. Becoming CLIMAVORE advocates for changing farming practices as well as the culture of eating. To become CLIMAVORE is to move beyond a carnivore, omnivore, locavore, vegetarian or vegan diet, and embrace a way of eating that tackles new seasonalities associated with the climate emergency, while addressing the extractive and intensive practices that lead to them. This has to happen not only in people’s kitchens, but also in collective eating spaces where infrastructural change can take place. Becoming CLIMAVORE is now a global network of food trucks, pizzerias, bakeries, ice cream parlours, Michelin-starred establishments, school canteens, collective kitchens, and other feeding spaces that are transitioning from becoming places that work primarily to nourish and restore human body, to places that also venture to care for the planet’s ecology.  They do this by creatively adapting their food offerings to the climate crisis. The transition starts with the removal of farmed salmon and other intensively farmed ingredients from the menu, replacing them with others that positively contribute to ebuilding habitats and restoring the planet.
