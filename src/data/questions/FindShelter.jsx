        'Shelter is far more than a roof over your head. Shelter, when done right, should provide protection, security, dignity, regional environmental sustainability and secure a place for everyone in the community to go, and where they feel like they belong. Incorporating essential spaces like free community recreation centers, accessible local parks or beaches, and integrated affordable housing within urban areas is vital for ensuring that our expanding communities prioritize the development of sustainable living environments and sheltered communities.',
        'Living in the housing crisis means individuals and families are facing home insecurity, or that they are putting 30% of their income or more into housing costs. It is imperative that as a community, we work towards making housing more accessible for all people. Governments and local municipalities have options and continuing to expand and build housing on the outskirts of town isn’t the answer. Urban sprawl leads to deforestation and loss of precious habitats for plant and animal species.',
        'Fortunately, many options exist that can make this goal a lived reality. For example, cooperative housing provides every-day citizens the opportunity to “buy into” the building they rent in as a member of the non-profit association. This model of housing provides affordability against the market and, when built with nature/ green spaces in mind, can positively impact co-op members’ lives, directly supporting happiness, community building, housing security and neighbourhood safety.',
        'Continuing to work towards sustainable, affordable housing requires that there is a shift towards high density housing, such as apartment buildings. A shift towards densification means that more people will have closer proximity to city cores, meaning more access to essential services such as transit. A new model called CO-HAB developed by Intelligent City renovates empty office buildings to accommodate the younger generations with units ranging from $50-60K. A series of small locked bedrooms with shared common spaces services, younger generations can be closer to work and the downtown scene. Former Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps put out the call at the 2024 Rising Economy Conference to find 500,000 square feet of vacant office space.',
        'Every development should be an opportunity to become more resilient to climate change and track towards long term health outcomes for the community. Municipalities know the value of working with community groups to restore watersheds.  Development proposals are a huge opportunity to protect from climate related natural disasters like heatwaves, earthquakes, floods and fires. By following the lay of the land and restoring the forest, wetland, watershed or coast we increase greenhouse gas drawdown, food security and biodiversity. By connecting greenspaces and watersheds we can manage temperature, water, wind speed while creating nice pathways for people to be self propelled by walking, biking or rolling.',
        'Talk to your friends and neighbors about solutions in your neighborhood, whether this means bike lanes, a community center, or calling your local government to talk about how your neighborhood can be a sustainable shelter for everyone!',
