Better computer models of how our buildings are performing are needed to give robust design solutions and evidence-based policies. Data-driven methods that use machine-learning have great potential as our buildings provide lots of data, but little is currently used for reducing emissions. The ReBuild Initiative is an industry-government-academia consortium that will undertake 16 projects that encompass the breadth and complexity of the challenge, each co-designed with a partner organization to apply specific areas of research to meet their needs.'
