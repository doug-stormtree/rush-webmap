Traffic medians, roads and walking trails provide long uninterrupted stretches of compacted soil but aerated good soil and mycelial networks could exist alongside if supported. Ecosystem types are identified to inform adjacent planting to enhance carbon drawdown.  Migration routes and fish bearing streams are identified as natural nutrient transporters.

The presence of excess soil moisture at the time of any field operation is the main factor leading to soil compaction. Once a soil is compacted, the bulk density and the strength of the soil are increased. For construction purposes, a compacted soil is ideal but under normal crop production, a compacted soil can be a serious problem. Penetration into the soil by tillage implements and crop roots is restricted. The movement of air and water through the soil is hampered causing the soil to remain wet and cool long into the growing season"',

We focus on the main principles of urban demonstration areas using biochars for C sequestration and explore the lessons learned from a co-creation process of one such park, Hyväntoivonpuisto in Helsinki, Finland. Demonstration sites of urban C sinks in public parks must be safe, visible and scientifically sound for reliable and cost-effective verification of carbon sequestration. We find that different interests can be arbitrated and that synergy that emerges from co-creation of urban C sink parks between stakeholders (scientists, city officials, companies, and citizens) can result in demo areas with maximized potential for impact, dissemination and consideration of principles of scientific experimentation."',
