        'Hydro power is a renewable energy source with a drastically lower carbon footprint relative to fossil fuels. When compared at the same scale to coal burning it is estimated to save 4 billion additional tonnes of greenhouse gasses per year.',
        'While much of BC’s energy is generated through hydro power, we sell some power to the US at a high price and buy it back at a lower price. This dynamic increases the amount of energy that is regularly lost in transmission and distribution across distances powerlines - estimated to be between 10-20%.',
        'The long-term outlook for hydropower is also raising concerns in other parts of the world as glaciers melt, delivering more water in the short term and less over time. Building dams needs to be considered alongside other functions that watersheds provide.',
        'Natural gas is our second biggest source and generates almost 10x the median greenhouse gas emissions intensity.',
        'It also comes with a host of expensive and risky extraction practices and, though more resilient of the fossil fuels in the market today, it will ultimately be substituted by renewables unless it can drastically mitigate emissions to comply with the 1.5 degree pathway.',
        'Hydraulic fracturing or fracking, deep underground drilling to access natural gas deposits can also contribute to earthquakes.',
        '90% of the costs associated with the liquified natural gas value chain occur up front so, as a province, we then commit to long term contracts in shipping it all over the world to make good on the initial investment risk.',
        'Research is also warning that the gas stoves and fireplaces at the end of the pipeline are not good for indoor air quality.',
        'It can seem like choices about power are outside the locus of our control but our population on Vancouver Island means that we are one of the largest customers of energy generated in BC so our consumption behaviour influences how the whole system operates.',
        'Quick pivots are hard to make but taking opportunities to access renewable energy that is generated close to the source would be ideal. Vancouver Island has a significant and growing number of alternative energy providers as the demand for local and renewable energy increases. T’Souke operates BC’s largest First Nation owned solar company.',
        'The Malahat Nation is developing integrated resource recovery infrastructure and is seeking industrial symbiosis partners.',
        'National and provincial government programs to increase the efficiency of buildings are plentiful and BC is a hotbed of innovation and talent when it comes to green developments. In 2019, GHG emissions from buildings, facilities, and infrastructure in the CRD have decreased by 21% since 2007, despite adding new buildings and facilities.',
        'Integrated Resource Recovery is a name for developments that co-locate buildings and businesses that can use each other’s waste heat, materials & energy. Some municipalities around the world have created local biogas fuel sources that are owned and operated by the local government creating a level of autonomy and sustainability that is impressive and practical.',
        'The CRD is upgrading the Renewable Natural Gas facility (RNG) facility at the Hartland Landfill. This carbon neutral biogas generated from decomposing organic waste will be fed into the regional gas system and is projected to reduce our regional footprint by 450,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next 25 years.',
        'The landfill is also home to the Residuals Treatment Facility which takes the region’s sewage that was pumped into the Juan de Fuca Strait until recently, and turns it into biogas using microorganisms. This biogas is used to process the remaining biosolids into pellets that are used as fuel to make cement on the mainland. At present we are bound by a 5 year contract with the cement company who we pay to take the fuel pellets but the opportunity to use this local fuel source is on the horizon when energy innovation catches up.',
