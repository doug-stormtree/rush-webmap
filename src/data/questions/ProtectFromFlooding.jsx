        'Our bodies and the surface of the planet are ~70% water. We depend on the water cycle to redistribute water around the planet so that we have enough to drink, clean and water the land. Climate change is altering this natural flow. Too much precipitation at one time leads to coastal flooding, backs up sewer systems, and floods urban communities. In 2021, atmospheric rivers brought so much water to BC that the land could not absorb it fast enough. The intense flooding resulted in damages that cost over 1 billion dollars in federal disaster aid. Many communities were displaced and southern BC’s food production industry was devastated.',
        'Our water is protected through the Groundwater Protection Regulation and the Water Sustainability Act but we lack the funding and tools to do the kind of monitoring that is needed. This region has many natural springs that must be taken into account when planning for development. This natural sources of clean water have been key to human and non- human survival over millions of years.',
        'When we overuse water resources the water table drops. Water scarcity is becoming a serious problem in many communities and the islands are already feeling it in this region. Even a small change in the level of the water table can become a big problem over a few years. Fish returning in the fall to their natal streams rely on the streams being recharged with groundwater. At that time of year it is the only source of water that is cool, clean and clear. For this recharge to occur, the water table levels need to be healthy. Cool, clean and clear water must be maintained throughout the year for the salmon and other lifecycles to persist.',
        'Proper stormwater management planning is a key part of the solution but, we need to ensure that our built infrastructure is working with the “natural infrastructure” that watersheds, wetlands, forests and coastal ecosystems provide. To protect communities from flooding we need to work with the water cycle and retain it where it falls by creating ways for it to be absorbed. This can happen through natural spaces, raingardens, laneway infiltrations, and bioswales. Copying Nature’s strategies for managing water is also known as designing nature-based solutions. Stormwater infrastructure design used to be mostly about drainage and getting the water off the land but, the practice is now evolving to create better infiltration, storage, and water recycling solutions.',
        'In the concrete jungle we can help recharge the aquifer with surfaces that drain linke paving stones, gravel, oyster shell hash, and natural materials like mulch.  Forests are key in recharging the aquifer as they capture, filter, store, and maintain healthy water levels. Natural vegetation that grows alongside watersheds is called a riparian area and is crucial in keeping stream water healthy and cool in drier spells, and stabilizing the bank during extreme water events.  Rain gardens mimic nature’s own “timed-release” system for maintaining healthy water levels for salmon (not too much, not too little). They also reduce the rate of toxins entering creeks and the ocean through the stormwater system.',
        'The City of Vancouver is beginning to use a strategy called laneway infiltration. The compacted dirt and rock is replaced with a gravel bed of various rock sizes and topped with a stable permeable surface. This design filters and recharges the aquifer, increases carbon drawdown, and helps protect communities from flooding  where sea level rise is projected to occur.',
        'Watersheds cross municipal and territorial boundaries. The Saanich Peninsula Environmental Coalition created a bioregional framework for municipalities that underscores the need for community perspectives, inter-jurisdictional collaboration, and ecosystem integrity. The goal is to encourage municipalities to work across boundaries in securing the health of all communities. The Cascadia Bioregional Movement seeks to heal the planet through stewardship of riversheds across the world. By taking simple actions and understanding why you should care, our aquifers can be protected through community conscience.',
