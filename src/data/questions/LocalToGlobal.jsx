      'Southern Vancouver Island is a traditional wintering ground for the lək̓ʷəŋən (Lekwungen) and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples because it was bountiful and protected. Vancouver Island is still considered lush by comparison to other parts of the world, but this sense of abundance can create the impression that Nature will handle it when humans intervene with old growth logging or salmon farms. In fact, our Coastal Douglas Fir ecosystem is considered critically endangered as a result of development pressures, recent climate change events, and resource extraction/interventions.',

Rather than being complacent in the quality of life Nature offers up everyday, we have the opportunity to be a node of health and resilience that the world’s human built and natural systems can connect to and rely on.',
