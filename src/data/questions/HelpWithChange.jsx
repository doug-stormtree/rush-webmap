Resilience comes from the strength of these connections, and the collective solutions that then emerge.',
        'In a moment of crisis, we need accountable leadership. As we saw during the pandemic, governments provide essential services. They make funding available to community organizations, the fastest change-agents of society. Through policy and regulations, they require businesses to consider people and the planet, and support them in creating innovative solutions. Governments can build partnerships for impact and create public value. They get their platform from what matters to the public, giving us enormous power to shape decision-making, but only when we choose to make our voices heard. We need your voice... and we all need to choose again and again to keep on voicing, even when we may feel shocked into silence by discouraging news - like the Federal Court’s November 2023 decision to overturn Canada’s ban on harmful single-use plastics.',
        'As we urgently move towards more sustainable ways of living, we have an opportunity to dismantle the systems that have caused harm and rebuild in ways that support thriving communities in alignment with the natural world. It is essential that we take our lead from Indigenous communities and their knowledge systems. Reconciliation and broader equity goals are possible when our environmental action is in line with our values.',
